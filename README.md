# wait-time-collecter-api

This is a flask web server, that responds to GET requests with a dictionary ("Hospital Name": emergency department wait time), for hospitals in the Vancouver Coastal regionthe 

I used Tesseract OCR for python, to extract the wait times from the png displayed on edwaittimes.ca, a website run by vancouver coastal health that reports wait times
every  minutes.
